My AI usage Examples: 

1. How to unpush, unstage, uncommit, merge, move the directory, see hidden files? and a bunch of other git commands.

2. I didn't quite understand the branches and merging in general and struggled with branch part in the CW1 submission.
So, I asked a bunch of questions. For example, is it possible to keep changes in the CW1 branch without merging?

3. What is maven, JaCoCo, spotbugs? What exactly is Junit? 

4. I encountered a lot of problems with moving the maven project to CW1, instead of CW1/CourseWork1. I asked Copilot back and forth.

5. java syntax, such as dictionaries, Map, HashMap
